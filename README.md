# hello-world
Just my first action here

Greetings people and maybe machines

Firstly, i would like to say that my main language is Portuguese, cause i'm in Brazil! So i'm sorry if i commit some mistakes. it would be a pleasure if you correct me when i'm wrong (if you want, obviously).

I'm here because i want to know new programming languages, i want to help in some open-source project (even thinking that my skills levels are very low ;-;) and mainly because i want to improve my Python skills. I'd like to know more about machine learning and AI, that's some subjects that i am very interested.

Here are some pieces of myself:
    I'm 16 years old;
    I'm on the second year of high school studing eletronics at one of the best technical schools of Brazil (Liceu de Artes e Ofícios de São Paulo);
    I'm trying to find some internship;
    I love Games. Actualy i'm playing Starcraft II and Dark soul III;
    I love some indie rock like Carne Doce (amazing band);
    
Enough, i thing you don't want to know more than this.

BE FREE TO CHAT WITH ME, IT'LL BE A PLEASURE :D
